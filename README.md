There is a bug - at a random moment the game can erase all non-default scripts in view of InlineObject on the map. I didn't find a solution to this problem (other than serializing Object and restoring via USaveGame) or using BattleClasters, so I didn't put it in the Epic store. Use it at your own risk.
